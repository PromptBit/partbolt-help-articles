description: Learn how to import existing data into your PartBolt database.

If you're coming to PartBolt from different inventory software (or a spreadsheet), we're happy to help import your existing data&mdash;just send an email to support@partbolt.com. We'll need two things to process the import:
* **Your existing data** in some sort of machine-readable format, like an Excel spreadsheet or CSV file.
* **The PartBolt database name**, which you can check by clicking the database icon in the top right, and then the "Manage databases" link.

We recommend importing data into an empty PartBolt database, since otherwise you might run into issues merging the imported data with what's already in PartBolt. We're happy to create a new database if that's what you want&mdash;just let us know.
