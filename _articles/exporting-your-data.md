We've made it easy to export your data as a machine-readable JSON file. That way, you don't have to worry about being "locked in" to using PartBolt&mdash;you can easily switch over to different software. Just follow these steps:
1. Click the **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-database"></i>** button in the top right.
2. In the menu that appears, click **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-cog"></i> Database settings**.
3. Click **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-file-export"></i> Export**.
4. You're done!

If you're using this data to switch to different software, we'd love to hear about your experience with PartBolt. You can send any feedback, positive or negative, to [support@partbolt.com](mailto:support@partbolt.com).
