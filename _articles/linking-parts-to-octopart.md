title: Linking parts to Octopart
layout: article
description: You can link parts in your inventory to Octopart, an online database of electronic components, to get quick access to documentation and other information.

When you create a part, you can choose to link it to an entry on [Octopart](https://octopart.com), a large database of electronic components. Doing so will automatically fill in details about the part, and let you access datasheets and other relevant documentation directly from PartBolt. We recommend linking parts to Octopart whenever possible.
