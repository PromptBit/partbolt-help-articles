When you create a part, you can choose to link it to an entry on [Octopart](https://octopart.com), a large database of electronic components. Doing so will automatically fill in details about the part, and let you access datasheets and other relevant documentation directly from PartBolt. We recommend linking parts to Octopart whenever possible.

To link a part to Octopart, hover over the **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-plus"></i> Add part** button and select the "<i class="fas fa-fw fa-search"></i> Search for part" option. Then, enter a search query for your part (such as its part number), find the matching part in the search results, and select **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-plus"></i> Add to inventory**.
