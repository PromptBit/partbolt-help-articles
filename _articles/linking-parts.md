When you create a part, you can choose to link it to an entry in our internal database of electronic components. Doing so will automatically fill in details about the part, and let you access its datasheets directly from PartBolt. Additionally, if the part is included in a project, live pricing information will be made available. We recommend linking parts whenever possible.

To create a linked part, hover over the **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-plus"></i> Add part** button and select the "<i class="fas fa-fw fa-search"></i> Search for part" option. Then, enter a search query for your part (such as its part number), find the matching part in the search results, and select **<i class="fas fa-fw fa-plus"></i> Add to inventory**.
